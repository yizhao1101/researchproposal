## Study of hydrogen production and storage options for transportation applications

The goal is to study the possible options to produce and store hydrogen for transportation applications and to study its integration in an industrial site.  

The study includes

1. Definintion of the hydrogen demand (typical profiles of flows, conditions, in time)
1. Hydrogen production technologies including technology readiness levels, cost and efficiencies
2. Hydrogen storage and supply
2. Techno economic analysis of the the hydrogen production systems, with installed power, integration with industrial activities, and competing solutions.
