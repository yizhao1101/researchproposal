## Study of the integration of a malting unit in a brewery

In collaboration with Buehler s.a. , the goal is to study the integration of a malting production unit in a brewery process. 

The study includes

1. process model of a brewery
2. hot and cold streams definition
2. process model of the malting unit (definition of the unit-process interface)
3. heat recovery and process integration options
4. energy conversion system integration
6. techno-economic and environmental impact assessment of the malting unit integration
7. opportunities for renewable energy integration by investigating the integration of the process in the energy system.
