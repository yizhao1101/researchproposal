# Process Design
## Optimal renewable integration in a refinery
*Internship or master thesis*

This project can be a master thesis or an internship. The assistant is in discussion with the industrial partner for possible funding opportunities.
<!-- This is an internship project co-supervised by TotalEnergies and IPESE. The candidate can decide to work in Paris or in Sion. This project aims to investigate the pathway of integrating renewables (PV and wind, etc.) in a refinery and the results have the possibility to be validated by a real case study provided by TotalEnergies. -->

### Context
In respond to the climate change, TotalEnergies, one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, adopted a Climate Ambition in 2020, addressing the target to achieve net zero across its worldwide operations by 2050 or sooner. Among all the operations, refinery was one of the most concerned, due to its large quantity of carbon emissions and its central position in maintaining a stable energy market by converting crude oil into fuels and feedstocks. In 2018, refinery process alone accounted for 40% of emissions from the oil and gas supply chain and 6% of all industrial carbon emissions [1].

There are a number of technologies that offer potential ways to mitigate the CO$_2$ emissions at refinery, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These technologies, despite their positive impacts on carbon density reduction, are actually largely dependent on steady and reliable clean electricity with low carbon footprints. Clean electricity is the key enabler and solid backing for refinery decarbonization.

Compared with solely importing electricity from grids, direct renewable integration has the potential to achieve highly efficient heat and power cogeneration. From the perspective of renewable sources, their intermittency can be mitigated or fully eliminated by the hydrogen demand and power generation in refinery, instead of relying on expensive batteries or other storage technologies. Last but not least, the renewable integration has the possibility to strengthen the energy security given that the stable operation is always one of the highest priorities for refinery.

In conclusion, this project aims to investigate the optimal pathway of renewable integration into a refinery. Various renewable sources, such as photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and wind energy, and their integration methodologies will be evaluated in the aspects of costs, environmental impacts and renewable intermittency. This project, which will be co-directed by TotalEnergies and IPESE at EPFL, has the potential to leverage the strengths of each part by applying the advanced research results into real-world industrial applications.

### Literature review
A plenty of studies and projects have been conducted on the renewable integration in general industry sectors. A report published by IEA in 2017 [2] reviewed and analysed 21 case studies of renewable integration on industrial sites and summarized 8 main issues for renewable integration, which are (1) energy production regulatory regime, (2) operability, (3) investment, (4) return on investment, (5) risk and insurance, (6) Contractual scheme complexity, (7) technology maturity and (8) awareness. They tried to look for solutions to these issues from the policy perspective and addressed the environmental benefits brought by renewable integration.

Specifically for oil and gas operations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US concluded that variability generation, system reliability and operability were three main constraints for renewable integrations. However, despite all these incoming challenges, the authors believed that the role of renewable generation in oil and gas operations could greatly increase and help both cost and emission reductions [3].

To the author's knowledge, the studies of renewable integration in a refinery are still limited to power integration under simple superstructure schemes. Alnifro et al. [4] at University of Waterloo proposed a superstructure method to optimize the electricity usage in various refinery processes. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-l1), they applied a linear programming to select the optimal connections between renewable sources and refinery processes to optimize both environmental impacts and costs. In this study, the potential benefits brought by heat integration were not considered. 
```{r refinery-l1, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Superstructure diagram for the crude oil refinery units connected with all available energy resources proposed by Alnifro et al [4]", out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('./figures/l1.png')
```
Recently, Switzerland-based Varo Energy Group and Groupe E announced the construction of a 7.7MW PV power plant to support the refinery's medium-voltage operation, releasing the signal that integrating renewable in a refinery has become commercially viable [5].

### Problem statement
Based on the literature studies, it is possible to envision the future refinery that leverages renewable power to decrease costs and maximize production while reducing environmental impacts. However, the studies and practices are still in a primary level today, only considering the power demand and ignoring the deep integration opportunities with heat and hydrogen production.

A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery is presented in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-l2). Cogeneration of heat and power is considered for the refining process. In addition, the surplus electricity is used for carbon capture and electrolysis process. The captured CO$_2$ can be co-electrolyzed with H$_2$ to produce synthetic gas for further methanol production. The produced H$_2$ is either used for refining process or for electricity generation in fuel cells.

## Power-to-X for long-term energy storage: hydrogen, methane or other chemicals?
*Semester project*

This project aims to compare various chemicals, including hydrogen, methane and methanol, for long-term energy storage from the perspectives of energy efficiency, cost and environmental impact. The student will have the opportunity to build connections with the industry.

### Background
Hydrogen has long been used by the chemical industry as a feedstock in industrial processes. Its role is likely to become more prominent in a fully decarbonised energy system. For instance, hydrogen can be used for long-term energy storage with the power-to-hydrogen-to-power processes. The power-to-hydrogen process allows the conversion of surplus renewable electricity into storable hydrogen fuel, whilst the hydrogen-to-power process converts the energy in hydrogen back into electricity with fuel cells or combined heating and power processes.

However, the storage of hydrogen is a key technological barrier to the use of hydrogen in energy storage. Hydrogen is an extremely light gas. Storage of hydrogen requires either the high-pressure above 350 bar or cryogenic temperatures, which bring extra cost and safety issues and drive researchers and engineers to look for promising alternatives to hydrogen. 

With CO$_2$ as feedstock, hydrogen can be further processed into methane, methanol, liquid fuels or other chemicals, which show the potential to replace hydrogen as intermediaries for energy storage thanks to their feasibility to be stored as liquid state. However, the additional synthesis process increases the complexity of the energy storage system, which can lead to an increase in the overall cost and energy loss.

In this study, a mathematical model will be built based on power-to-x-to-power concept for hydrogen and its potential alternatives. The student will be able to answer what is the best option for "X" based on the model and multicriteria analysis. 

### The project
The main questions to be answered in this project include:

- What are the main power-to-x technologies used for energy storage and their respective advantages and disadvantages?

- How to define the performance matrix for the long-term energy storage system?

- What are the thermodynamic limits of the system? Where are the losses from?  Which losses are avoidable and which ones are not?

- What are the cost and carbon emission sources of this kind of system?

- Which one is the best option for long-term energy storage under which circumstance?


### For candidates
The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles:

- High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.

- Good knowledge of energy systems and renewable technologies.

- Coding skills (Python or R) are a plus.

## CO2 capture and natural gas treatment in the presence of sulfur 
*Master project*


### Context 
An industrial site, located in France, uses locally extracted methane-rich gas. This gas has a high content of sulphur compounds when compared to the standard natural gas from the grid. The presence of sulphur limits the local use of the extracted gas. Further, it cannot be injected into gas grid without sulphur treatment. The grid injection of this gas also requires CO2 removal to achieve the grid quality. 

In this project, a process model will be developed for the sulphur treatment and CO2 capture from the extracted gas. The process design and operation will be optimized to achieve high process efficiency and low cost of gas treatment. Finally, best possible solutions will be identified to treat and valorise this gas, and to limit the sulphur emissions. 

### The project
This project will be organised in the following steps. 

- Analysis and understanding of the research  problem.
- Develop model for gas treatment (sulphur removal) and CO2 capture.
- Optimization of the gas treatment process.
- Integration of gas treatment process with industrial site. 

### Skills

## Batteries recycling models
*Semester/Master project*


### Context 
The global electric car fleet grew to 10.9 million vehicles in 2020, which amounts to three million more than in the previous year. From 2030 onward, electric vehicles could make up between 25 and 75 % of new registrations. This will lead to a demand for battery power of between 1 and 6 TWh per year, depending on the study one reads.

As electric vehicles become more widespread, the demand for special raw materials for the vehicles and, in particular, for the batteries will continue to grow. All the forecasts indicate that lithium-ion batteries will be the standard solution for electric cars over the next ten years and so the main substances needed will be the chemical elements graphite, cobalt, lithium, manganese
and nickel. Despite the developments in cell chemistry, the proportion of lithium by weight in each cell of around 72 g/kg is not likely to reduce noticeably during this period, according to estimates by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI). The demand for primary raw materials for vehicle battery production by 2030 should amount to between 250,000 and 450,000 t of lithium, between 250,000 and 420,000 t of cobalt and between 1.3 and 2.4 million t of nickel.

To reduce the world’s dependence on the raw material producing countries, establishing a comprehensive recycling structure will become increasingly important in the future. Processes for recovering raw materials from small lithium-ion batteries, such as those in cell phones, are in part already being implemented. However, vehicle batteries are much larger, heavier and more powerful, which makes industrializing the recycling process more complex. The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), together with Vinnova, Sweden’s innovation agency, is funding the Libero research project at RWTH Aachen University as part of the Central Innovation Program for SMEs (ZIM). The German-Swedish consortium, consisting of two partners from industry and two from the research world in each country, is working on developing a robust, flexible and largely waste-free process for recycling batteries. The goal is to plan a plant with an annual recycling capacity of 25,000 t of battery mass. The Finnish company Fortum, has already developed a process for recycling lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles.

One of the pioneers in the field of commercial battery recycling is Umicore. The process developed by the company consists of a pyro-metallurgical and a hydro-metallurgical phase. The initial thermal processing stage produces an alloy that contains cobalt, nickel and copper and a slag fraction. The metals are recovered in the subsequent hydro-metallurgical stage of the process. Umicore’s first recycling plant has a capacity of 7,000 t of battery mass per year, which corresponds to around 35,000 electric-vehicle batteries.
In early 2021, Volkswagen began operations at a pilot plant for recycling high-voltage vehicle batteries at its site in the German town of Salzgitter. The plant will recover 100 % of the lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt, plus 90 % of the aluminum, copper and plastic. The plant is currently designed to recycle up to 3,600 battery systems per year, which is the equivalent of around 1,500 t of battery mass. However, the system can be scaled up to process larger volumes when more used batteries become available. According to Volkswagen, the recycling process does not involve smelting in a blast furnace, which would use large amounts of energy. The used battery systems delivered to the plant are deep discharged and disassembled. The individual parts are shredded to form granulate and this is then dried. The process produces aluminum, copper and plastics and, most importantly, a black powdery mixture that contains the essential battery raw materials: lithium, nickel, manganese, cobalt and graphite. Specialist partners of Volkswagen are subsequently responsible for separating and processing the individual elements by means of hydro-metallurgical processes that use water and chemicals.

### The project
This project will be organised in the following steps. 

- Analysis and understanding of the main recycling treatments (published papers and patents).
- Model development for batteries recycling, according to the latest state-of-the-art.
- Integration (and optimization) of the recycling process within a national/global supply chain.

- Understanding of energy integration and process optimization
- Results interpretation and report writing
- Language skills: English (C1/C2 level)
- Coding skills: Python is a plus

## Design of Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based Fast Charging Point for Electric Vehicles
*Master project*


### Context 
An industrial collaborator would like to design solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) based fast charging points for electric vehicles (EV). In this project, bio-ethanol and/or bio-ethane will be used as fuel to the SOFC system, and prototype of fast charging point will have power output of more than 100 kW. The SOFC has a very high fuel to electricity efficiency, and waste heat available from the system can be used in the operation of fuel cell and/or supply heat to industrial clusters or district heating network. 

In this project, master student will use SOFC model developed by GEM (EPFL) / IPESE (EPFL) in Aspen Plus, and will interface it with the OSMOSE platform (developed by IPESE), which is a tool for the design, integration and optimization of energy system. This project will require: (1) optimal design of the SOFC stack to achieve high electric efficiency, (2) upscaling of the SOFC stacks to achieve desired output power for the protype, (3) optimize the operation of fast charging points to satisfy demand profiles. 

As the first step, a steady-state process design / model will be modified and optimized. Then, student will compare different system configurations and perform a multi-objective optimization to explore the tradeoff among conflicting objectives, such as energy efficiency, prototype cost, weight and volume of prototype. For each optimal configuration, an optimal heat exchange network will be synthesized that will be used by the industrial collaborator as the starting point for designing heat exchangers, and other components. 

### The project
This project will be organised in the following steps. 

- Analysis and understanding of the research  problem.
- Modification and optimization of SOFC model.
- Design and configuration of prototype (fast charging point). 
- Operation optimization of prototype.  

### Skills

## Hybridization algorithm for the future of electric aircrafts
*Master project*


### Context 
The GENESIS project will gauge the environmental sustainability of electric aircraft (A/C) in a life- cycle-based, foresight perspective to support the development of a technology roadmap for transitioning towards sustainable and competitive electric A/C systems. 

To realize future concepts for hybrid electric aircraft, existing technology gaps and barriers for energy storage, supply and transmission will need to be overcome. New and disruptive solutions will be required e.g. for compact and lightweight modules for electrochemical power sources, power electronics and electric drives, as well as for on ground energy supply solutions.
Based on the requirement analysis, a bottom-up technology analysis shall be made for the most relevant technologies with a perspective on the selected technology streams and timeframes. Considering the three major technology streams and the relevant system for energy handling the analysis can be structured into sub-tasks oriented towards battery technology, fuel cell technology, technology for turbine / ICE propelled generator sets, and hybrid technologies resulting from their combination as well as on-ground energy supply to aircraft.

Although fuel cell based hybrid systems represent a very large potential for meeting the challenges of an environmentally-sustainable energy supply for aircraft, research is still at its infancy and little results and little implementation in actual aircraft applications have been realized (and none for regional class aircraft). In addition, a complete systematic overview of possibilities for producing hydrogen fuel with low environmental impacts (e.g. from renewable energy sources, like wind power) and for enabling its storage in aircraft remains to be made.

### The project
The goal of this master thesis would be to design a hybridization algorithm on the energy system of the aircraft. The model should consider many different variables and find the optimum configuration according to specific requirements. The analysis should be based on technology performances, voltage curves, costs and GHG emissions. In addition, simulations of the functional behavior of the power system (fuel cells combined with batteries) for a regional electric aircraft for 50 pax should be implemented.

This project will be organised in the following steps. 

Short overview of the current and forecasts performances of battery and FCs
• Development of a hybrid system model to simulate the behavior of the battery and the fuel
cell.
• Development of the hybridization algorithm to optimize the power system.
     o Integration of the degradation for batteries based on Open-sesame (https://gitlab.ti.bfh.ch/oss/esrec/open-sesame).
     o IntegrationofdegradationforFCs
• Simulations for different timelines (2030, 2040, 2050+)
• Simulations for different fuel – H2 – CH4
• Opportunity to publish an article and be co-author on the next GENESIS report.
