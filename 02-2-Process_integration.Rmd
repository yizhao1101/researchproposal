## Study of a dairy process

In collaboration with CremoSA (Villars-sur-Glane) , the goal is in particular to study the integration of high temperature heat pumps in the milk production and the associated industrial site.

The study includes

1. energy audit
2. hot and cold streams definition
3. heat recovery
4. energy conversion system integration
5. use of the heat pump superstructure model to identify the opportunities for heat pump integration
6. techno-economic and environmental impact assessement of the heat pumping options and the $CO_2$ mitigation options for the industrial process and the cleaning in place
7. opportunities for renewable energy integration by investigating the integration of the process in the energy system.
