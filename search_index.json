This project aims to investigate the pathway of integrating renewables (PV and wind, etc.) in a refinery and the results have the possibility to be validated by a real case study provided by TotalEnergies. The candidate is expected to start before 2023. 2.1 Context In response to the climate change, TotalEnergies, one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, adopted a Climate Ambition in 2020, addressing the target to achieve net zero across its worldwide operations by 2050 or sooner. Among all the operations, refinery was one of the most concerned, due to its large quantity of carbon emissions and its central position in maintaining a stable energy market by converting crude oil into fuels and feedstocks. In 2018, refinery process alone accounted for 40% of emissions from the oil and gas supply chain and 6% of all industrial carbon emissions (“World Energy Outlook 2018 – Analysis” n.d.). There are a number of technologies that offer potential ways to mitigate the CO\\(_2\\) emissions at refinery, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These technologies, despite their positive impacts on carbon density reduction, are actually largely dependent on steady and reliable clean electricity with low carbon footprints. Clean electricity is the key enabler and solid backing for refinery decarbonization. Compared with solely importing electricity from grids, direct renewable integration has the potential to achieve highly efficient heat and power cogeneration. From the perspective of renewable sources, their intermittency can be mitigated or fully eliminated by the hydrogen demand and power generation in refinery, instead of relying on expensive batteries or other storage technologies. Last but not least, the renewable integration has the possibility to strengthen the energy security given that the stable operation is always one of the highest priorities for refinery. In conclusion, this project aims to investigate the optimal pathway of renewable integration into a refinery. Various renewable sources, such as photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and wind energy, and their integration methodologies will be evaluated in the aspects of costs, environmental impacts and renewable intermittency. This project, which will be co-directed by TotalEnergies and IPESE at EPFL, has the potential to leverage the strengths of each part by applying the advanced research results into real-world industrial applications. 2.2 Literature review A plenty of studies and projects have been conducted on the renewable integration in general industry sectors. A report published by IEA in 2017 [2] reviewed and analysed 21 case studies of renewable integration on industrial sites and summarized 8 main issues for renewable integration, which are (1) energy production regulatory regime, (2) operability, (3) investment, (4) return on investment, (5) risk and insurance, (6) Contractual scheme complexity, (7) technology maturity and (8) awareness. They tried to look for solutions to these issues from the policy perspective and addressed the environmental benefits brought by renewable integration (Galichon et al. 2017). Specifically for oil and gas operations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US concluded that variability generation, system reliability and operability were three main constraints for renewable integrations. However, despite all these incoming challenges, the authors believed that the role of renewable generation in oil and gas operations could greatly increase and help both cost and emission reductions (Ericson, Engel-Cox, and Arent 2019). To the author’s knowledge, the studies of renewable integration in a refinery are still limited to power integration under simple superstructure schemes. Alnifro et al. (Alnifro 2017) at University of Waterloo proposed a superstructure method to optimize the electricity usage in various refinery processes. As shown in Figure 2.1, they applied a linear programming to select the optimal connections between renewable sources and refinery processes to optimize both environmental impacts and costs. In this study, the potential benefits brought by heat integration were not considered. Figure 2.1: Superstructure diagram for the crude oil refinery units connected with all available energy resources proposed by Alnifro et al Alnifro (2017) Recently, Switzerland-based Varo Energy Group and Groupe E announced the construction of a 7.7MW PV power plant to support the refinery’s medium-voltage operation, releasing the signal that integrating renewable in a refinery has become commercially viable (“Switzerland’s Largest Solar Park Planned to Power Refinery” n.d.). 2.3 Problem statement Based on the literature studies, it is possible to envision the future refinery that leverages renewable power to decrease costs and maximize production while reducing environmental impacts. However, the studies and practices are still in a primary level today, only considering the power demand and ignoring the deep integration opportunities with heat and hydrogen production. A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery is presented in Figure 2.2. Cogeneration of heat and power is considered for the refining process. In addition, the surplus electricity is used for carbon capture and electrolysis process. The captured CO\\(_2\\) can be co-electrolyzed with H\\(_2\\) to produce synthetic gas for further methanol production. The produced H\\(_2\\) is either used for refining process or for electricity generation in fuel cells. Figure 2.2: A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery The mission of the internship will be focusing on the completion of the conceptual study and identify the economically and technically feasible pathway of integrating renewable in a refinery. The questions to be answered in this project include: What will be the potential technologies to be integrated into a refinery? What are their advantages? Identify the barriers to renewable integration. The barriers may include: How to deal with the intermittency of renewable energies? How to keep the system realiable and operable with renewble integration? What are the transition pathway from the current refinery to the refinery with renewables? What are the suitable sustainability metrics to compare and optimise the generated pathways? How to improve the work? How to validate the results? 2.4 For candidates The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.

The answer is obviously “NO”! From the experience of PV panels, it is summarized that the price of a technology will decrease with its global shipment. This phenomenon is named as “learning effect”. There are a number of reasons behind the learning effect, such as scaling effect, learning by doing and research &amp; development efforts. However, there is lacking a button-up model which can reveal the mechanisms behind the price reduction. In addition, the carbon footprint evolution is less addressed by researchers but with great importance. 3.2 Problem statement This project will address the cost and carbon footprint evolution based on a detailed scaling model developed in 2022 by Lu. PEMEC and SOEC technologies will be considered as a typical technology. The candidate will continue to complete and improve the existing cost model developed on R. The detailed tasks will include the following: Collect the cost and carbon footprint data of the electrolysis technologies. Connect the existing model with the LCA database – ecoinvent and conducted the LCA of the electrolysis technologies. Introduce learning by doing and R&amp;D efforts into the model and forecast the price evolution of the electrolysis technologies. Simplify the model by machine learning or some other artificial methods. 3.3 For candidates The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.

During the transition process, different investment decisions are going to be made to phase out the outdated technologies, resize the existing technologies, and introduce the novel technologies. When and how to make those decisions will have a profound impact to the cost and environmental impacts. For instance, the prompt investment decision may lead to to a high total cost but low carbon emission over the transition period, vice versa. Therefore, a systematic way to provide guidance to the decision maker is essential to be addressed. 4.2 Problem statement You will investigate the transition process of the refinery today to the future one. A multi-period model based on a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) method will be used to capture the key features of the transition process. Different technology options will be considered such as power-to-X, biorefinery and carbon capture and storage. When and how to integrate these new options into a conventional oil refinery will be studied based on the multi-objective optimization framework to balance the trade-off between carbon footprints and cost. The detailed tasks include: Be familiar with the existing oil refinery model and understand the technologies to decarbonize the refining industry. Establish database for different decarbonization technologies including their cost, carbon footprints and energy profiles. Apply MILP method to generate the transition pathway to the future. Build KPI matrix to compare different transition pathways systematically. 4.3 For candidates The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.
