[["index.html", "Student Projects 1 Introduction", " Student Projects IPESE 2022-06-19 1 Introduction The IPESE group is proposing an integrated concept of teaching where semester/master projects and lectures are considered as a whole entity. The undergraduate studies for the mechanical engineering master combine lectures and projects. Thus it is recommended that the students realizing a project in our lab also register to the lectures given by Prof. Maréchal. The lab is now located in the new campus of EPFL in Sion . Students will be reimbursed for the travel to Sion. You will find all necessary details together with contact information on the respective project page. Students interested in doing a semester or master project in IPESE and who have not found a specific project of interest in the list of available projects can send a CV together with a motivation letter and a transcript of records (Bachelor, Master) to StudentProjectsIPESE. Your chances of finding an appropriate supervisor increase, when directly contacting a person from the IPESE lab. Therefore, visit the research pages to find your supervisor. IPESE is also involved in the Minor in Energy: realize your master in 2 years with a special focus on energy and obtain the engineering master + a minor in Energy. Students are welcomed at IPESE for semester projects, minor in energy projects and master projects. It is strongly recommended to select the projects with some continuity and consistency, selecting for example semester projects that concern different aspects of the same technology and that prepare the master thesis. The subjects cover different aspects on the fields of research of the IPESE group as can also be seen by the completed projects.

The assistant is in discussion with the industrial partner for possible funding opportunities. 2.1 Context In respond to the climate change, TotalEnergies, one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, adopted a Climate Ambition in 2020, addressing the target to achieve net zero across its worldwide operations by 2050 or sooner. Among all the operations, refinery was one of the most concerned, due to its large quantity of carbon emissions and its central position in maintaining a stable energy market by converting crude oil into fuels and feedstocks. In 2018, refinery process alone accounted for 40% of emissions from the oil and gas supply chain and 6% of all industrial carbon emissions [1]. There are a number of technologies that offer potential ways to mitigate the CO\\(_2\\) emissions at refinery, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These technologies, despite their positive impacts on carbon density reduction, are actually largely dependent on steady and reliable clean electricity with low carbon footprints. Clean electricity is the key enabler and solid backing for refinery decarbonization. Compared with solely importing electricity from grids, direct renewable integration has the potential to achieve highly efficient heat and power cogeneration. From the perspective of renewable sources, their intermittency can be mitigated or fully eliminated by the hydrogen demand and power generation in refinery, instead of relying on expensive batteries or other storage technologies. Last but not least, the renewable integration has the possibility to strengthen the energy security given that the stable operation is always one of the highest priorities for refinery. In conclusion, this project aims to investigate the optimal pathway of renewable integration into a refinery. Various renewable sources, such as photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and wind energy, and their integration methodologies will be evaluated in the aspects of costs, environmental impacts and renewable intermittency. This project, which will be co-directed by TotalEnergies and IPESE at EPFL, has the potential to leverage the strengths of each part by applying the advanced research results into real-world industrial applications. 2.2 Literature review A plenty of studies and projects have been conducted on the renewable integration in general industry sectors. A report published by IEA in 2017 [2] reviewed and analysed 21 case studies of renewable integration on industrial sites and summarized 8 main issues for renewable integration, which are (1) energy production regulatory regime, (2) operability, (3) investment, (4) return on investment, (5) risk and insurance, (6) Contractual scheme complexity, (7) technology maturity and (8) awareness. They tried to look for solutions to these issues from the policy perspective and addressed the environmental benefits brought by renewable integration. Specifically for oil and gas operations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US concluded that variability generation, system reliability and operability were three main constraints for renewable integrations. However, despite all these incoming challenges, the authors believed that the role of renewable generation in oil and gas operations could greatly increase and help both cost and emission reductions [3]. To the author’s knowledge, the studies of renewable integration in a refinery are still limited to power integration under simple superstructure schemes. Alnifro et al. [4] at University of Waterloo proposed a superstructure method to optimize the electricity usage in various refinery processes. As shown in Figure 2.1, they applied a linear programming to select the optimal connections between renewable sources and refinery processes to optimize both environmental impacts and costs. In this study, the potential benefits brought by heat integration were not considered. Figure 2.1: Superstructure diagram for the crude oil refinery units connected with all available energy resources proposed by Alnifro et al [4] Recently, Switzerland-based Varo Energy Group and Groupe E announced the construction of a 7.7MW PV power plant to support the refinery’s medium-voltage operation, releasing the signal that integrating renewable in a refinery has become commercially viable [5]. 2.3 Problem statement Based on the literature studies, it is possible to envision the future refinery that leverages renewable power to decrease costs and maximize production while reducing environmental impacts. However, the studies and practices are still in a primary level today, only considering the power demand and ignoring the deep integration opportunities with heat and hydrogen production. A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery is presented in Figure 2.2. Cogeneration of heat and power is considered for the refining process. In addition, the surplus electricity is used for carbon capture and electrolysis process. The captured CO\\(_2\\) can be co-electrolyzed with H\\(_2\\) to produce synthetic gas for further methanol production. The produced H\\(_2\\) is either used for refining process or for electricity generation in fuel cells. Figure 2.2: A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery The mission of the internship will be focusing on the completion of the conceptual study and identify the economically and technically feasible pathway of integrating renewable in a refinery. Different tasks include: The development of system integration models based on the process integration and th superstructure concepts. Build database and identify cost and limitations for possible technologies that can be used in the superstructure, including: the energy conversion technologies renewable energy harvesting technologies capture, reuse and sequestration technologies Hydrogen production usage and storage Develop the suitable sustainability metrics to compare and optimise the generated pathways. The decision support method based on multi-criteria analysis using the models to identify the most important options. 2.4 For candidates The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.

Semester project This project aims to compare various chemicals, including hydrogen, methane and methanol, for long-term energy storage from the perspectives of energy efficiency, cost and environmental impact. The student will have the opportunity to build connections with the industry. 3.1 Background Hydrogen has long been used by the chemical industry as a feedstock in industrial processes. Its role is likely to become more prominent in a fully decarbonised energy system. For instance, hydrogen can be used for long-term energy storage with the power-to-hydrogen-to-power processes. The power-to-hydrogen process allows the conversion of surplus renewable electricity into storable hydrogen fuel, whilst the hydrogen-to-power process converts the energy in hydrogen back into electricity with fuel cells or combined heating and power processes. However, the storage of hydrogen is a key technological barrier to the use of hydrogen in energy storage. Hydrogen is an extremely light gas. Storage of hydrogen requires either the high-pressure above 350 bar or cryogenic temperatures, which bring extra cost and safety issues and drive researchers and engineers to look for promising alternatives to hydrogen. With CO\\(_2\\) as feedstock, hydrogen can be further processed into methane, methanol, liquid fuels or other chemicals, which show the potential to replace hydrogen as intermediaries for energy storage thanks to their feasibility to be stored as liquid state. However, the additional synthesis process increases the complexity of the energy storage system, which can lead to an increase in the overall cost and energy loss. In this study, a mathematical model will be built based on power-to-x-to-power concept for hydrogen and its potential alternatives. The student will be able to answer what is the best option for “X” based on the model and multicriteria analysis. 3.2 The project The main questions to be answered in this project include: What are the main power-to-x technologies used for energy storage and their respective advantages and disadvantages? How to define the performance matrix for the long-term energy storage system? What are the thermodynamic limits of the system? Where are the losses from? Which losses are avoidable and which ones are not? What are the cost and carbon emission sources of this kind of system? Which one is the best option for long-term energy storage under which circumstance? 3.3 For candidates The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment.
