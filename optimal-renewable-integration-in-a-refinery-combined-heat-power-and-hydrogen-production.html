<p><em>Internship</em></p>
<p><em>Autumn 2022</em></p>
<p>This is an internship project co-supervised by TotalEnergies and IPESE. The candidate can decide to work in Paris or in Sion. This project aims to investigate the pathway of integrating renewables (PV and wind, etc.) in a refinery and the results have the possibility to be validated by a real case study provided by TotalEnergies.</p>
<div id="context" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Context<a href="optimal-renewable-integration-in-a-refinery-combined-heat-power-and-hydrogen-production.html#context" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In response to the climate change, TotalEnergies, one of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world, adopted a Climate Ambition in 2020, addressing the target to achieve net zero across its worldwide operations by 2050 or sooner. Among all the operations, refinery was one of the most concerned, due to its large quantity of carbon emissions and its central position in maintaining a stable energy market by converting crude oil into fuels and feedstocks. In 2018, refinery process alone accounted for 40% of emissions from the oil and gas supply chain and 6% of all industrial carbon emissions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noauthor_world_nodate" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“World <span>Energy</span> <span>Outlook</span> 2018 – <span>Analysis</span>”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies that offer potential ways to mitigate the CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> emissions at refinery, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS). These technologies, despite their positive impacts on carbon density reduction, are actually largely dependent on steady and reliable clean electricity with low carbon footprints. Clean electricity is the key enabler and solid backing for refinery decarbonization.</p>
<p>Compared with solely importing electricity from grids, direct renewable integration has the potential to achieve highly efficient heat and power cogeneration. From the perspective of renewable sources, their intermittency can be mitigated or fully eliminated by the hydrogen demand and power generation in refinery, instead of relying on expensive batteries or other storage technologies. Last but not least, the renewable integration has the possibility to strengthen the energy security given that the stable operation is always one of the highest priorities for refinery.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this project aims to investigate the optimal pathway of renewable integration into a refinery. Various renewable sources, such as photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and wind energy, and their integration methodologies will be evaluated in the aspects of costs, environmental impacts and renewable intermittency. This project, which will be co-directed by TotalEnergies and IPESE at EPFL, has the potential to leverage the strengths of each part by applying the advanced research results into real-world industrial applications.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Literature review<a href="optimal-renewable-integration-in-a-refinery-combined-heat-power-and-hydrogen-production.html#literature-review" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A plenty of studies and projects have been conducted on the renewable integration in general industry sectors. A report published by IEA in 2017 [2] reviewed and analysed 21 case studies of renewable integration on industrial sites and summarized 8 main issues for renewable integration, which are (1) energy production regulatory regime, (2) operability, (3) investment, (4) return on investment, (5) risk and insurance, (6) Contractual scheme complexity, (7) technology maturity and (8) awareness. They tried to look for solutions to these issues from the policy perspective and addressed the environmental benefits brought by renewable integration <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-galichon_fostering_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Galichon et al. 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Specifically for oil and gas operations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US concluded that variability generation, system reliability and operability were three main constraints for renewable integrations. However, despite all these incoming challenges, the authors believed that the role of renewable generation in oil and gas operations could greatly increase and help both cost and emission reductions <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ericson_approaches_2019" role="doc-biblioref">Ericson, Engel-Cox, and Arent 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
To the author’s knowledge, the studies of renewable integration in a refinery are still limited to power integration under simple superstructure schemes. Alnifro et al. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-alnifro_optimal_2017" role="doc-biblioref">Alnifro 2017</a>)</span> at University of Waterloo proposed a superstructure method to optimize the electricity usage in various refinery processes. As shown in Figure <a href="optimal-renewable-integration-in-a-refinery-combined-heat-power-and-hydrogen-production.html#fig:refinery-l1">2.1</a>, they applied a linear programming to select the optimal connections between renewable sources and refinery processes to optimize both environmental impacts and costs. In this study, the potential benefits brought by heat integration were not considered.

<p>Recently, Switzerland-based Varo Energy Group and Groupe E announced the construction of a 7.7MW PV power plant to support the refinery’s medium-voltage operation, releasing the signal that integrating renewable in a refinery has become commercially viable <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-noauthor_switzerlands_nodate" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Switzerland’s Largest Solar Park Planned to Power Refinery”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Based on the literature studies, it is possible to envision the future refinery that leverages renewable power to decrease costs and maximize production while reducing environmental impacts. However, the studies and practices are still in a primary level today, only considering the power demand and ignoring the deep integration opportunities with heat and hydrogen production.</p>
A possible scenario of renewable integration in refinery is presented in Figure <a href="optimal-renewable-integration-in-a-refinery-combined-heat-power-and-hydrogen-production.html#fig:refinery-l2">2.2</a>. Cogeneration of heat and power is considered for the refining process. In addition, the surplus electricity is used for carbon capture and electrolysis process. The captured CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> can be co-electrolyzed with H<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> to produce synthetic gas for further methanol production.

<!-- # Transition to Clean Road Transport with Low Carbon Fuels -->
<!-- *Master thesis* -->
<!-- *Autumn 2022* -->
<!-- ## Context -->
<!-- Road transport provides broad-scale benefits for society, such as connectivity and territorial cohesion, better access to markets and employment opportunities. However, at the same time, road transport is one of the largest emission sources in Europe, accounting for approximately 18\% of total EU-28 GHG emissions [@clean_planet_2018]. Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C will require rapid decarbonization of the road transport sector, which means reducing emissions by at least 60\% by 2050 as compared to the levels in 1990 [@noauthor_transport_nodate]. -->
<!-- For passenger or light-duty vehicles, electrical vehicles (EVs) have been proven to be a mature technology to replace the conventional fossil fuel based vehicles. The ban of internal combustion engine from 2035 was officially announced by EU in June 2022. However, as the range and mass of the vehicles increase, electrification becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore, alternative low carbon fuels and their respective powertrains are required to achieve deep decarbonization of heavy duty transport.  -->
<!-- Low carbon fuels can be based on two different feedstocks: sustainable biomass(biofuels) or renewable electricity (e-fuels). Their corresponding manufacturing processes, fuels and powertrains are included in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-lcf1). It is worth noting that the same fuels (chemicals) can be produced from various feedstocks and there are competitions between a number of low-carbon drive-technologies. The transition to net zero is critical but never straightforward. -->
<!-- This project aims to obtain an overview of the road transport sector in Europe. The student will build databases of different low carbon fuel manufacturing technologies in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-lcf1) and identify their cost, environmental impacts, and technology readiness levels. Linear programming method will be applied to generate a series of potential solutions and the optimal one will be selected based multi-criteria analysis. -->
<!-- <!-- %This project is within the scope of "the Refinery of the Future" and will help define the future refinery system. -->
<p>–&gt;</p>
<!-- ```{r refinery-lcf1, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="A concept structure of the fuels and powertrains with potential applications for the road transport sector", out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics('./figures/lcf1.png') -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## Literature Study -->
<!-- An enormous quantity of researches have been conducted and several excellent review articles provides an extensive picture of the decarbonization pathways in EU transport sector. Gray et al. [@gray_decarbonising_2021] did a comprehensive analysis of various low carbon energy carriers in the haulage (heavy vehicle) sector and identified two key barriers facing the update of alternatives to fossil fuels --- fuel costs and a lack of refueling infrastructure. Noll et al. [@noll_analyzing_2022] conducted a total cost of ownership analysis for road-freight in Europe. It was suggested that the increasing policy flexibility and vehicle efficiency were the key enabler to drive the competitiveness of low carbon fuels. -->
<!-- Concawe is the scientific division of the European Refining Association. In 2021, Concawe published a scenario analysis study for the transition towards low carbon fuels by 2050 [@concawe_2021]. In this report, three scenarios with different levels of low carbon fuel penetrations in road transport were proposed. In addition, the required technologies and investment to achieve the scenarios were identified and calculated.  -->
<!-- ## The missions -->
<!-- Low carbon fuel has always been one of the main research interests in the IPESE group. Special focuses have been put on various biofuel production routes and co-electrolysis. A large number of biofuel and e-fuel process models and data already exist. What is lacking now is a systematical way to evaluate and integrate them into an overall picture of the European transportation system. -->
<!-- In addition, the linear programming tool is quite mature in the lab and there are no special requirements for the mathematical knowledge. The main programming language of this project will be R or Python, depending on the background of the candidate. -->
<!-- The project will be organized in the following steps: -->
<!-- - Conduct an exhaustive literature review and complete the concept structure in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-lcf1). -->
<!-- - Build database on the basis of existing models and data in the lab, including the following technologies: -->
<!--   - Low carbon fuel manufacturing technologies -->
<!--   - Corresponding powertrains for different low carbon fuels -->
<!--   - Road transport vehicles -->
<!-- - Develop the suitable sustainability metrics to compare and optimise the generated pathways from linear programming. -->
<!-- - The decision support method based on multi-criteria analysis using the models to identify the most important options. -->
<!-- ## For candidates -->
<!-- The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: -->
<!-- - High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment. -->
<!-- - Good knowledge of energy systems and renewable technologies. -->
<!-- - Coding skills (Python or R) are a plus. -->
<!-- - System thinker and problem-solver oriented. -->
<!-- - It is strongly recommended if it is possible for the candidate to work on-site in Sion, which is located in the middle of Alps, ideal for hiking. -->
<!-- The candidate will develop different competencies, such as project management experience, technical knowledge with renewables and mathematical optimizations, and critical thinking skills, etc.  -->
<!-- ## Supervising -->
<!-- The thesis will be supervised by Prof. François Maréchal from EPFL. Yi Zhao and one of his colleagues will serve as the assistant to this project.  -->
<!-- If interested, please take contact with Yi Zhao (yi.zhao@epfl.ch) attaching your CV, Cover Letter and transcript of records (Bachelor’s and Master’s). Short-listed candidates will be interviewed. Early applications are encouraged. -->
<!-- ## Practical information -->
<!-- The IPESE group is located in Sion (EPFL Valais) at about 1h05 from Lausanne train station. The transportation fees between Lausanne and Sion will be reimbursed by the lab. -->
<!-- <!-- TotalEnergies is a company headquartered in Paris. If this project is accepted as an internship by the company, the candidate can choose to work in France or in Switzerland. In this case, the scope of the project will be adapted appropriately, as well as the supervision. -->

<!-- # The future of chemical production: crude oil to chemicals? -->
<!-- *Master thesis* -->
<!-- *Autumn 2022* -->
<!-- ## Context -->
<!-- Most refineries focus on producing transportation fuels, which accounts for 50% of total refinery products today. However, with the rapid deployment of electrical vehicles (EVs) and the increasing decarbonization requirement of the transport sector, the demand for transportation fuels is expected to drop significantly. Recently, EU officially banned the sale of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars from 2035, marking the end of an old era. -->
<!-- Another important product of refinery is naphtha, which is the feedstock for petrochemical industry. The demand for chemicals, such as plastics, fibers and other polymers, is positively related to the GDP level and keeps growing in the last several decades. Therefore, it is foreseeable that the focus of the refinery production will gradually shift to chemicals. -->
<!-- Refiners will have to act in respond to the product spectrum change. One possible solution is the integration of refinery and petrochemical processes, that is, producing chemicals directly from crude oil instead of from the naphtha, and at the same time reducing the production of transportation fuels. However, the direct conversion from crude oil to chemicals (COTC) requires a large retrofit of existing refinery facilities and receive doubts of its environmental benefits. -->
<!-- In this project, the student will investigate the design of COTC processes. The focus will be on the life cycle assessment (LCA). The transition from current refineries to the future ones will be particularly emphasized considering the huge capital investment required for the oil and gas industries. The student is expected to obtain an overall understanding of the chemical industry from this project. -->
<!-- ## Literature Study -->
<!-- COTC projects have already received a lot of attentions and a number of COTC plants have been planned in China or the Middle East. A representative project is Hengli's refinery factory for producing Paraxylene, which achieved a full trial operation in May 2019. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:refinery-chemical1), the central process of the COTC is still the distillation unit, while various cracking processes are used to crack the long carbon chains into short ones. Reforming process is for the generation of aromatics in the product. The announced investment cost for this project reached 11.6 billion dollars [@noauthor_crude_2019]. -->
<!-- There are also other COTC factories operated by Saudi Aramco aiming for ethylene and propylene production, for which steaming cracking is integrated to produce light hydrocarbon gases. -->
<!-- Regarding to the environmental impact, a large quantity of research works give particular emphasis on chemical production from biomass and renewable electricity. However, there is not a clear statement of the environmental impact of COTC process. Further literature studies are required. -->
<!-- ```{r refinery-chemical1, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap="Configuration of the Hengli's refinery factory for Paraxylene production", out.width = "80%", echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics('./figures/chemical1.png') -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## The missions -->
<!-- This project will be centered on the question "Will crude oil still be needed in the future to produce chemicals?". It will be spitted into the small sections to be answered in the below: -->
<!-- - What others have already done with the COTC processes? How to evaluate their processes? -->
<!-- - How to improve the existing COTC processes? Chemical product recycling, especially plastic recycling, will be considered an important part in the process design. -->
<!-- - What are the cost and environmental impacts of the COTC processes?  -->
<!-- - Compared the COTC process with the production of chemicals from biomass and renewable electricity. What are the advantages and disadvantages to produce chemicals from fossil fuels? -->
<!-- - How to improve the work and how to validate the simulation results? -->
<!-- ## For candidates -->
<!-- The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: -->
<!-- - High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment. -->
<!-- - A good background in chemical engineering will be preferred but not required. -->
<!-- - Coding skills (Python or R) are a plus. -->
<!-- - System thinker and problem-solver oriented. -->
<!-- - It is strongly recommended if it is possible for the candidate to work on-site in Sion, which is located in the middle of Alps, ideal for hiking. -->
<!-- The candidate will develop different competencies, such as project management experience, technical knowledge with renewables and mathematical optimizations, and critical thinking skills, etc.  -->

<!-- # # Power-to-X for long-term energy storage: hydrogen, methane or other chemicals? -->
<!-- # *Semester project or master thesis* -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # *Autumn 2022* -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # ## Background -->
<!-- # Hydrogen has long been used by the chemical industry as a feedstock in industrial processes. Its role is likely to become more prominent in a fully decarbonised energy system. For instance, hydrogen can be used for long-term energy storage with the power-to-hydrogen-to-power processes. The power-to-hydrogen process allows the conversion of surplus renewable electricity into storable hydrogen fuel, whilst the hydrogen-to-power process converts the energy in hydrogen back into electricity with fuel cells or combined heating and power processes. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # However, the storage of hydrogen is a key technological barrier to the use of hydrogen in energy storage. Hydrogen is an extremely light gas. Storage of hydrogen requires either the high-pressure above 350 bar or cryogenic temperatures, which bring extra cost and safety issues and drive researchers and engineers to look for promising alternatives to hydrogen. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # With CO$_2$ as feedstock, hydrogen can be further processed into methane, methanol, liquid fuels or other chemicals, which show the potential to replace hydrogen as intermediaries for energy storage thanks to their feasibility to be stored as liquid state. However, the additional synthesis process increases the complexity of the energy storage system, which can lead to an increase in the overall cost and energy loss. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # This project aims to compare various chemicals, including hydrogen, methane and methanol, for long-term energy storage from the perspectives of energy efficiency, cost and environmental impact. A mathematical model will be built based on power-to-x-to-power concept for hydrogen and its potential alternatives. The student will be able to answer what is the best option for "X" based on the model and multicriteria analysis. The student will have the opportunity to build connections with the industry. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # ## The project -->
<!-- # The main questions to be answered in this project include: -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - What are the main power-to-x technologies used for energy storage and their respective advantages and disadvantages? -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - How to define the performance matrix for the long-term energy storage system? -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - What are the thermodynamic limits of the system? Where are the losses from?  Which losses are avoidable and which ones are not? -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - What are the cost and carbon emission sources of this kind of system? -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - Which one is the best option for long-term energy storage under which circumstance? -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # ## For candidates -->
<!-- # The successful candidate is expected to have the following profiles: -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - High-level motivation and ability to work in an autonomous environment. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - Good knowledge of energy systems and renewable technologies. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - Coding skills (Python or R) are a plus. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # - System thinker and problem-solver oriented. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # The candidate will develop different competencies, such as project management experience, technical knowledge with renewables and mathematical optimizations, and critical thinking skills, etc. -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # ## Supervising -->
<!-- # -->
<!-- # The project will be supervised by Prof. François Maréchal from EPFL. Yi Zhao will serve as the assistant to this project. -->
